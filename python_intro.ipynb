    "# Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python** is an [interpreted](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/compiled-versus-interpreted-languages/), high-level, object-oriented programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991. It is considered a 'general purpose' programming language due to its flexibility and wide variety of applications (eg. Python can be used to build simple games, for backend in web development, and as we will learn, it is well-suited for data analytics, mathematics, and machine learning.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python files have a `.py` extension, and you can run them from your terminal with the script `python filename.py`. Your code will be executed, and the terminal will display any results you have printed to be reviewed. The code runs top to bottom - if there is an error at some point, the code will exit at that point and the rest will not run until the next execution. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also be using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) files, which have a file extension of `.ipynb` (which stands for **interactive python notebook**). The benefit of using Jupyter Notebook files is that we can combine both Markdown and Python into a single file, which makes for easy documentation of your code, but also the code blocks can be run individually without the need to run the entire script every time. This could be achieved in Python files using functions and imports, but then your code would be spread across multiple files. \n",
    "\n",
    "The print statements will also stay in the Notebook's memory even between sessions, which can be handy! But the active variables only exist for the current session. Even though the print statement is still visible, the next time you open VSCode you will need to run the code blocks again if you want to interact with any of the variables. To see your current variable values, there is a button in the top menu for \"Variables\". Run a single block by clicking the triangle \"play\" button on the block, or with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>, or run all blocks by clicking \"Run all\" at the top. \n",
    "\n",
    "Blocks can be collapsed to save space. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) is a good resource if this is still a bit confusing, but you will have plenty of practise in the coming weeks!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Print\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python `print()` statement is going to be extremely useful for you! This is how you communicate what your code has accomplished. Jupyter Notebook code blocks have a little shortcut syntax that prints the _last_ variable you reference. It might sometimes be necessary to print multiple values at different point, in which case you can use the print function. Comma-separate values to print as many things as you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, **variables** hold information, and the [data type](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp) of your variables will provide options for different functionalities. Python will infer the type of your variable from the way it has been defined. If you are ever unsure, you can check the data type of your variable with the `type()` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Declare a variable by assigning it a name (Python users tend to favour **snake_case** to handle multiple word names). When you want to use the value of your variable, your refer to it by the declaration name. Be aware that variable names should be unique! If you reuse the same variable name later in your script, you are overwriting the value of the previous variable rather than creating a new one. This may or may not be your intention. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Primitive Types\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primitive types** hold a single value, these include **text**, **numeric** and **boolean** types. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Numeric Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric types will have additional methods for mathematical operations. Numeric types come in 3 categories:\n",
    "  - **Integer** is a round number\n",
    "  - **Float** (floating point number) is usually a decimal number, can also be a scientific number\n",
    "  - **Complex** created from two real numbers (used in mathematics)\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric data types can be used together with [**arithmetic operators**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_arithmetic_operators.asp): \n",
    "  - addition `+`\n",
    "  - subtraction `-`\n",
    "  - multiplication `*`\n",
    "  - division `/`\n",
    "  - modulus (remainder) `%`\n",
    "  - exponentiation (raise to a power) `**`\n",
    "  - floor division (round down) `//`"
